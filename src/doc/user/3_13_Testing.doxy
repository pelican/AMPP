\page user_testing Testing Utilities

In addition to the core framework, Pelican includes a utility library
(\c pelican-testutils) consisting of a number of classes and functions
which are designed to be used in testing code written using Pelican.

The test utility classes derive from the extensive unit testing central to the
development of Pelican, and examples of there use can be found in the unit tests
in the source code distribution of the library as well as in relevant sections
of the reference documentation.

\section user_testing_cppunit Testing with CppUnit

Unit tests used in the development of Pelican make use of the the CppUnit
test framework (documentation can be found at
<a href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/lastest/index.html" target="_blank">
http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/lastest/index.html</a>) which provides
a simple framework for developing and running tests either individually or as
part of a test suite.
